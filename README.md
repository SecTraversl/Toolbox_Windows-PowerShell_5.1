# Windows_PowerShell_5.1_Tools

- This repo contains a bulk of tools and categories I have created using Windows PowerShell 5.1, with the intent to make it easy to do a "git clone" and grab all of the pertinent tools for PowerShell in a single download.  
- I am, however, updating the categories, further curating the tools, and providing more uniform documentation for each category (subfolder) and making dedicated repos for each category.  
- The dedicated repos will have the most up-to-date content, and once I have those dedicated repos to a good place I will create a process so that both the dedicated repo and this consolidation repo have the same content.
