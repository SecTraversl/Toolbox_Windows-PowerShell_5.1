SeImpersonatePrivilege,"Impersonation is one of the most used privileges in Windows. It allows for a user, program, or thread to impersonate a client or specified account. Programs, threads, or services use this privilege to perform tasks that require different permissions. A ""user sends requests and commands over the network to the server; the service uses the Security Access Table (SAT) representing the user to act on behalf of the user” (Fossen, Securing Windows with PowerShell and the Critical Security Controls, 2016). Tools like Incognito use this privilege to impersonate users.  (""Maleficent Seven"", in Notes section)"
SeDebugPrivilege,"This privilege is not needed by a developer in order to debug their program, because users by default can debug their own application.  This privilege gives the ability to attach to any program and read. Tools such as Mimikatz (Metcalf, 2016), or reflective DLL injection (Graham, 2016) use this privilege. By default, only the local Administrators group has the Debug Programs privilege (Fossen, Securing Windows with PowerShell and the Critical Security Controls, 2016).  (""Maleficent Seven"", in Notes section)"
SeTcbPrivilege,"The SeTcbPrivilege privilege allows a user or process to act as part of the operating system. If a user or process has this privilege, it can request any other privilege and can even create a token that does not have an identity. Microsoft describes a token (specifically, a SAT) as: ""an object that describes the security context of a process or thread. The information in a token includes the identity and privileges of the user account associated with the process or thread"" (Microsoft, 2017). A user with this privilege is like a user with a golden ticket (Warren, 2017). The user can create tickets that can mimic other users. "
SeCreateTokenPrivilege,"Windows creates a Security Access Token (SAT) for a user when they logon to the system. As resource requests occur from the user, the SAT is referenced in order to validate that access is allowed. With the SeCreateTokenPrivilege, a user is able to grant themselves access to the local administrators group.  (""Maleficent Seven"", in Notes section)"
SeLoadDriverPrivilege,"Users will be able to load and unload device drivers at will with the SeLoadDriverPrivilege. The SeLoadDriverPrivilege could be used to load a malicious driver into the operating system. Device drivers run at kernel level allowing them to circumvent any operating restrictions. Under some conditions, this privilege, with some registry tricks, would allow for an unsigned driver to be loaded.  (""Maleficent Seven"", in Notes section)"
SeRestorePrivilege,"The SeRestorePrivilege (which is used to restore files) can be assigned to other groups or users outside of the Backup Operators group. With this privilege, a user can bypass current permissions in order to restore a file or directory. The SeRestorePrivilege is the equivalent of giving a user ""Traverse folder / Execute file and Write"" permissions on all files and directories; thereby allowing for a bypass of ""NTFS permissions and replace any file"".  Consequently, this allows for files to be 'backdoored' (Fossen, Securing Windows with PowerShell and the Critical Security Controls, 2016).  (""Maleficent Seven"", in Notes section)"
SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege,"A user or process with SeOwnershipPrivilege can take ownership of any Active Directory object. Objects in the domain such as files, folders, registry keys, services, processes, and threads can be changed. Even if access is denied via current permissions, this privilege allows for ownership of the file/folder to be taken, and thereafter permissions can be changed in order to gain access.
